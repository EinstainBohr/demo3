# Rain On Car

![Rain On Car Demo](/RainOnCarDS/RainOnCarScreenshot.png)

QtQuick3D demo application. The demo is based on QtQuick3D 5.15, and requires Qt 5.15 to work without having to hack things manually. It is a Qt Design Studio 1.5 project, and does not include a standalone application project at all. 

The application showcases a way to fake rain, that even flows on the car. It also includes simple UI to control some post-processing effects, color of the car, and turning the rain on or off.
