# DynamicMetersDemo

QtQuick3D DynamicMeters demo application. The demo is based on QtQuick3D 5.15, and requires Qt 5.15 to work without having to hack things manually.

The application contains 3D view with dynamically painted meter components. QNanoPainter library is used for the painting. There is a settings UI to control some of the features and to adjust the default settings you can modify Settings.qml file.
